Problem 6 : PLay with files and directories
create  3 files named   abc.txt  ok  fine  g.txt  /tmp directory 
  create  4  directories   aa aaa aaaa  under  /tmp directory 
  give ls command to  list the content of  /tmp directory 
  make sure it will only list the content (file|directory)  having 2 char in their name.

$ cd /tmp
$ vim abc.txt
$ vim fine
$ vim ok
## or we can use $ touch /tmp/{abc.txt,ok,fine}
$ mkdir aa aaa aaaa aaaa
$ ls -d ??
