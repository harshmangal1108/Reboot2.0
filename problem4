Problem 4: Problem #4.  share and files and folder 


create two users name jack and Jill  from command line
create all the data under home directory of each users 
login with jack user and create a file name  jack.txt using vim editor and write "hello jack"
from jack user also create two directories name jack1 & jack2 
now login from Jill user and create a file. Jill.txt using vim editor and write "hey jiil"
from Jill also create two directoires named jill1 & jill2 

## 1 create user jack and jill
$ useradd jack jill
$ passwd jack ##set "jack"
$ passwd jill ## set "jill"
### login with jack
$ su jack
chmod 0777 /home/jack
vim jackfile ##enter something text in here file
mkdir jack{1..2}


### login with jill
$ su jill
$ chmod 0777 /home/jill
$ vim jill ## enter something here alsoo in file
$ mkdir jill{1..2}
 
#### Finally we have to swap all data under home dirs of both 
Note : we are at jill user
$ cp -r /home/jack/* ./
$ su jack
$ cp -r /home/jill/* ./

### After you can delete file but important to set permissions back 
$ chmod	455 /home/jack && chmod 455 /home/jill
